a:2:{s:7:"content";s:711:"<p>After 13 years in inside sales both on the front lines and leading teams, I made the decision to follow my passion. Since programming in BASIC on my dad's TI/99-A at 5, I have always had a love for software engineering. In 2016, I made the leap to resume my pursuit of my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at University of Illinois, while working full time and raising two toddlers. I have maintained a 4.0 GPA through 12 classes. In 2017 I got my first software development job and now I won't ever look back!</p>
<p>I am a family man, a lifelong learner, a libertarian, a cryptocurrency enthusiast, an electronic and indie music lover, a member of the PC master race, and a problem solving addict.</p>
